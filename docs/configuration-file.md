# Configuration File

The configuration file is a yaml file containing all required parameters used by
different parts of the library.

Different sections of the file are used by different components of the library,
such as the sampler, or for creating the dynamic model. Thus, not all configuration
options may be required to be adjusted by you, depending on what features of
the framework/library you use.
